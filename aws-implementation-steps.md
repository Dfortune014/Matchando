# Implementing AWS Event Tracking

To send the game events to AWS, we need to:

1. Install the AWS SDK:
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-eventbridge
```

2. Create an AWS EventBridge client configuration
3. Modify the analytics.ts file to send events to AWS EventBridge
4. Set up AWS credentials securely

## Implementation Steps:

1. Update the analytics.ts file to use AWS EventBridge
2. Configure AWS credentials using environment variables
3. Create necessary IAM roles and permissions
4. Set up event patterns in EventBridge

I will implement these changes in the next iterations.
